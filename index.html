        <p>Hello! My name is Luis Pacheco and I am from Guayaquil, Ecuador. I like to watch soccer, it is my favorite
            sport to watch. My favorite team is Club Sport Emelec, the first national Champion in Ecuador. The club was
            actually founded by George Lewis Capwell from the USA. I am very excited to keep learning about programming
            and web design, it is so challenging for me. Hopefully, I will learn and finish my degree.</p>
